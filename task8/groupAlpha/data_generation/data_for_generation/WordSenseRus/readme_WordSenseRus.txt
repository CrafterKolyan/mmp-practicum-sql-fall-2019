This dataset contains human-annotated sense identifiers for 2562 contexts of 20 words used in the RUSSE'2018 shared task on Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation for the Russian language. Assembled by Dmitry Ustalov in 2017. In particular, 80 pre-annotated contexts were used for training the human annotators, and 2562 contexts were annotated by humans such that each context was annotated by 9 different annotators. After the annotation, every context was additionally inspected (“curated”) by the organizers of the shared task.

Accuracy results for some aggregation models are:
Percentage Agreement: 0.906591
Krippendorff Alpha Agreement: 0.825366
Randolph Kappa Agreement: 0.875454
